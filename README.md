# M2C2kit Overview

[`m2c2kit`](https://m2c2-project.github.io/m2c2kit/) is a Typescript/Javascript framework for rapid-creation and iteration of cognitive assessments.

## About this Repository of Integration Guides

With the web-based implementation of M2C2kit assessments, it is possible for them to be embedded via Qualtrics, REDCAP, and Metricwire (as well as anything else with a WebView[cite]).

This repository contains implementation guides for using M2C2kit. 

The `templates` folder will contain examples of different ways in which you may configure m2c2kit cognitive assessments, e.g., in Qualtrics.
