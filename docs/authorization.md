# <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Getting Started - Authorization</span>



## Note: This authorization process will need to be completed by each team member who wants to use the Jupyter Notebook. 

### If you are an external collaborator outside of PSU and you have not yet contacted us, please reach out to us immediately at m2c2@psu.edu and do not proceed.  

* Go to this URL: [https://prod.m2c2kit.com/docs#/authentication/sign_up_auth_register_post](https://prod.m2c2kit.com/docs#/authentication/sign_up_auth_register_post)

* Contact our team to add the study name to our system by filling out this study form: **[Authorization Study Creation Request Form](https://airtable.com/app0JQhjqc5VNZMpZ/shrAqgkD5GD3hHOKI)**  **IMPORTANT:** This form only has to be completed *ONCE* for your study. Skip this step and the next step if a team member has already completed this form.

* Wait for us to confirm that the study has been successfully created. (Again, skip this step if a team member has already completed the above form)
* Once you have been confirmed to have been authorized and the study has been added, click ‘Authorize’ located at the very top of the form and input your username and password.
